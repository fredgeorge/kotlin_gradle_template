## Purpose

This is a starting template for a Kotlin project using Gradle.
Included is also support for persistence 
using Kotlin-serialization.
Code behavior is in the _engine_ package. 
Tests are in the _tests_ package to encourage testing 
of public behavior of the engine.
Similarly, the persistence layer is in the _persistence_ package.
The persistence package stops with encoding and decoding the
engine classes; interfaces to the outside world (databases,
REST APIs, or event busses) should be in yet other packages.

More on persistence is below.

## Starting template for a Kotlin project using Gradle

Kotlin is relatively easy to set up with IntelliJ IDEA. 
Gradle is used for building and testing the project and is a 
prerequisite. Install if necessary.
The following instructions are for installing the code 
in IntelliJ IDEA by JetBrains. 
Adapt as necessary for your environment.

Note: This implementation was set up to use:

- IntelliJ 2026.1 (Ultimate Edition)
- Kotlin 2.3.20 (targeting Java 25 bytecode)
- Java SDK 25 LTS (Oracle)
- Gradle 9.4.1
- JUnit Jupiter 6.0.3 for testing
- Kotlin-serialization 1.8.1 for JSON

Open the reference code:

- Download the source code from github.com/fredgeorge
    - Clone or pull and extract the zip
- Open IntelliJ
- Choose "Open" (it's a Gradle project)
- Navigate to the reference code root and enter

Source and test directories should already be tagged as such,
with test directories in green.

Confirm that everything builds correctly (and the 
necessary libraries exist). From a terminal window:
```bash
./gradlew clean build test
```
There is a sample class, Rectangle, with a corresponding
test, RectangleTest. The test should run successfully
from the Gradle __test__ task.

Several settings may need to be manually changed if using IntelliJ IDEA:

- In File - Project Structure - Project Settings - Project, set SDK to 25 (or whatever you earlier SDK)
- In File - Settings - Build, Execution, Deployment - Compiler - Kotlin Compiler, set the Target JVM version to 25
- In File - Settings - Build, Execution, Deployment - Build Tools - Gradle, set Gradle JVM to JAVA_HOME or explicitly and select the latest Kotlin versions

Update the following: 

- In settings.gradle.kts, change the rootProject.name
- In both engine and tests, choose your domain name for your code under the kotlin directory
- Consider renaming the <engine>, <tests>, and <persistence> package names to your domain-specific convention.

## Persistence

Peristence is separated from the domain model (engine).
If imbedded in the model, complexity can compromise the
clarity of the model design. To the maximum extent
possible, peristence should be separated from the model.

Persistence is handled by the Kotlin-serialization library. It 
provides a convenient way to serialize and deserialize 
Kotlin data classes to and from JSON and Base64 formats. 
This ensures that data can be easily stored and transmitted 
while maintaining its structure and integrity.

The _Memento Pattern_ (Design Patterns book) is used as the 
model for persistence. The pattern suggests an object can 
present a binary representation of itself that can only 
be reinterpreted by the object's class itself. It can't be 
used as an _encapsulation_ bypass.

The example injects _memento_ creation with an extension method
into the Rectangle class. It further injects restoration of the
class into the Companion object of Rectangle.

The base Rectangle class, to support the Memento Pattern,
defines a properly populated DTO in response to toDto(), and
must have a Companion object as a target for the restoration
injection. If JSON serialization is to be supported in creating
the memento, _@Serializable_ must be tagged on the DTO.

The creation of the _memento_ is done in the 
RectanglePersistence helper functions in the
persistence package, including the injection of the creation and
restoration functions. This helper class is solely 
responsible for the format and content of the _memento_.

The Encoding object allows for gneration and 
restoration in either JSON or Base64 formats. Base64 
properly _hides_ the content of the memento from prying 
eyes. _Polymorphism_ support exists with SerializersModule 
parameter on JSON creation.
